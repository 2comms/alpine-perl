# alpine-perl

Perl on Alpine Linux

This is an experimental build of Perl on Alpine Linux. The test
harness is disabled during build because of a UTF-8 test failure that
I haven't had time to track down.

Use at your own risk.

This Perl image is 186.7 MB--about 28% the size of the offical Perl
Docker Hub image.
